## Setup

- Create Supabase account at [database.new](https://database.new)
- Create `.env.local` file by running `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
- Add your credentials from the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)

## ğŸš€ How to use on web

- Run `yarn` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to try it out.

## How to use on native mobile

Since `react-native-mmkv` is not supported in Expo Go, you will need to perform a native build locally by running:

```js
npx expo prebuild

npx expo run:android
npx expo run:ios
```

## How to generate types

```bash
supabase start
supabase gen types --lang=typescript --local > utils/database.types.ts
```
